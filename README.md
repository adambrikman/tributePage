<h1>Tribute Page for David J. Malan</h1>
<!-- /TITLE -->

<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->
The goal of this project was to create a simple HTML/CSS tribute page for anyone of my choosing. I chose David Malan because I took CS50 and loved his course. To show my appreciation, I created this page for him.

This project was built with HTML and CSS and was completed as part of the Free-Code-Camp curriculum.
